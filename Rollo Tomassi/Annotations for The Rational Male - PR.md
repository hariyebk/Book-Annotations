## Women's Dual Sexual Strategy


<p  text align = "justify">There are methods and social contrivances women have used for
centuries to ensure that the best male’s genes are selected and secured
with the best male provisioning she’s subjectively capable of attracting.
Ideally the best Man should exemplify the best of both aspects, but
rarely do the two exist in the same male (particularly these days), so in
the interest of achieving her biological imperative, and prompted by an
innate need for security, the feminine as a whole needed to develop
social conventions and methodologies (which change as her
environment and personal conditions do) to effect optimizing women’s
innate Hypergamy. </p>

<p text align = justify> Alpha fucks , Beta bucks principle :- women giving ambiguous promises that sex will be offered to the beta unattractive male in return if the he treats her well, take her out to dates, buy her dinner, bring her gifts, etc, hence Beta Bucks.  all the while as the alpha get to have sex right away without having to do all that in advance because he is physically attractive and confident. Around the time of ovulation women prefer more masculinized faces . faces with features that indicate high levels of testosterone. These facial cues predict high genetic quality in the male because only such males can afford the immune system-compromising effects of testosterone. One of the negative consequences of high testosterone level males is that they are associated with high rates of offspring abandonment.  which can be costly for her interms of resources and protection needed to raise the offspring alone. At other points during the cycle, women will prefer more feminized male faces, as they might signal a higher willingness of the males to invest in offspring (provision). <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">the drive for an optimization between the best direct genetic benefit (sex) and the best indirect benefit (parental investment and provisioning) is a biologically hard-wired feature of the female mind.</mark> </p>

<p text align = "justify">The follicular phase starts on the first day of menstruation and lasts for about 14 days. During this phase, the ovaries produce several follicles, and one of them matures and releases an egg during ovulation, which occurs around day 14 of the menstrual cycle marking the start of the luteal phase.  The luteal phase lasts for about 14 days also. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">the latter half of the follicular phase – the period between day 7 to about day 14 might be called the Alpha Phase for Men .  This 7 (maybe 10) day window predisposes women to (Alpha) masculinized sexual influence and would be the optimal period for a man to make a lasting Alpha impression. It’s during this phase masculine body odor becomes more appealing and an overall preference for masculinized physical attributes (muscularity) intensifies as arousal cues for her in men. all a guy need do is be the right man at the right time to bring this out in them. An understanding of the behavioral changes of Ovulatory Shift during women’s menstrual cycle is key. In other words, this is the period in which Hypergamy doesn’t care the most. It’s “fuck me now, I’ll rationalize it out later.”  You may ask but how
do I determine what cycle phase a woman is in?”  During this phase high amount of estrogen hormone is produced by the follices , so she will likely act more feminine</mark>. </p>

<p text align = "justify">In the luteal phase of menstrual cycle ( the last 14 days ) women  become attracted to more feminine features in men , attributes associated with comfort, familiarity, empathy, nurturing, etc. meant to reinforce the perception that a man is a good choice for long-term parental investment Beta prone men believe this at face value and don’t strike while the iron’s hot (the proliferate phase), wait her out and wonder why they get a, “lets just be friends” at the end of her luteal phase. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">You need to ensure that your offspring receives your resources, rather than investing in offspring that may not be biologically related to you. For a woman, the biological jackpot is to secure a commitment of genetics and resources from a mate who registers higher than herself in SMV valuation but this rarely occur in a single person.</mark> <p/>

## Women's life Timeline


<p text align = "justify">By design this graph isn’t intended to be a specific outline to account for
every woman’s individual circumstances, but a somewhat predictable series
of phases coordinated with events, behaviors and mental schema that occur
during those phases. The perspective I’ve approached in this outline is one
of an unattached (long term single) or semi-monogamous woman with the
personal and social options to leverage her sexual agency. the purpose of this time line is to serve as a general direction for women’s maturation and the priorities of attraction cues they put on men’s attributes during these phases of their lives so you can exploit them when needed and be aware of the bait . <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">you need to have a basic grasp of who you’re dealing with, and what motivates her according to what priorities she places on men and herself at any phase of life</mark> as well as considering the social influences she’s being subjected to.</p>

### The Teen Phase

<p text align = "justify">This time line however is intended as a road map to follow to get a better understanding of what motivates women at particular phases of their lives and hopefully help men to better prepare themselves for the strategies women will use to optimize Hypergamy during those phases.  Between the ages of 15 and 19 young women associate and prioritize their
sexual selectivity according to men’s physical features. during  this years her foremost attraction is for the ‘hot guy’ with a good body, the correct eye color, facial symmetry and the right
haircut.  <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">The main reasoning for this is fairly obvious in that physical cues  are primarily innate. In other words, a teenage girl simply doesn’t have the life experience or a sense of provisioning
necessity for much else to be an attraction consideration for her.</mark> Extrinsic attraction
cues such as status and social proof do factor in progressively as girls
mature, but  at this phase of her life the priority is the physical. Long term provisioning potential during this phase is rarely even an
afterthought for a young woman because  her provisioning needs are being relatively
accommodated by her  family. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">if
things aren’t secure at home (Daddy Issues) an adolescent girl physically
and mentally prepares herself for a long term providing mate earlier than when a
solid, positive-masculine father is present in her life and in the home</mark>.</p>


### The party Years

 <p text align = "justify">
The five-year span between 20 and 25 are what I euphemistically call a
woman’s ‘Party Years’. It’s at this stage women generally experience their
peak SMV (22-23 years old), and as I stated in the Navigating the SMP
post, at no other point in a woman’s life will so many socio-sexual options
be available to her<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">. A lot of manosphere moralists believe that women ought to marry and get
pregnant during the party years since this is the point of peak fertility as
well as physical beauty, and in the not so distant, pre-sexual revolution past
this certainly made sense. However, under the social conditions of the last
60 years, women’s priorities have changed.
The available opportunities – social, sexual, educational and career-wise –
that a woman experiences during these years are afforded to her in relation
to her SMV. At no point will you find a woman more cocky and selfassured
of her predominance in society according to the options she enjoys
relative to her attractiveness.</mark> Her personal image will be one based on
merit, and while it’s certainly possible she is talented or intelligent, her
opportunities are predicated on her attractiveness and the leverage it has on
other’s (men and women’s) decision making.
<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">The physical arousal priorities she had in high school remain a top
attraction priority, however, as she matures into the new experiences her
SMV peak affords her, status, and later affluence (wealth or potential
provisioning) start getting added to the attraction mix. As women learn the
utility of their relative SMV, and begin to understand a future need for long term provisioning (on some level of consciousness) they come into a better
understanding of the transactional nature of their sexual agency.
It’s during the party years that women begin to prefer ‘dating’ men older
than themselves. At this phase, this is generally between a 4-6 year
difference. During the party years, Hypergamy is still firmly rooted in physical
attraction and short term mating cues, however, it’s during this time women
begin to develop an appreciation for the personality cues of confidence and
(Alpha) character as it relates to her long term investment.</mark> As a woman starts to slowly leave the party years and 
becomes more cognizant of her decreasing 
capacity to sexually compete with the attractiveness of younger women, her
attraction for more than just the physical aspects of men begins to assume a
higher priority. Those aspects (status, confidence, affluence, realized
ambitions, worldly maturity, etc.) are typically found in men old enough to
have had the experience to acquire them.</p>

### Social Conventions

<p text align = "justify">These conventions may be more or less pronounced for a
teenage girl depending on her parents’ involvement in her upbringing, but
popular culture and a feminine-primary social order already have a preestablished
series of conventions she’s expected to invest herself in.
For the most part these conventions key upon an implied superiority of her
gender while ridiculing any valuable aspect of masculinity beyond a Beta
boy’s oafish usefulness to her.  when it comes to fighting, girls and boys engage in different types of aggression. While boys tend to engage in physical combat, girls engage in psychological combat by denying or reinforcing attention within a female social collective. which  implies that girls are more likely to fight with each other in a social context, and that they use psychological tactics to compete for attention and social status. Little girls have a predictable tendency to form small, girl-only collectives or ‘peer clutches’ from the time they are introduced into kindergarten. This dynamic can last through high school (i.e. cliques, etc.), into college
and into mature adulthood, but the commonality within all variations of this
clutch is the qualifying influence of the affirming power of attention. The worst consequence of such a dispute  is being ostracized from the
group, thus the absolute denial of this reaffirming attention-as reinforcement.
This attention can be from any source; within the group,
outside the group, but opposite sex attention becomes the most valuable
after puberty. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Attention-attraction capacity denotes social rank within the
peer clutch. The more attractive the girl, the more popular she becomes and
the more influence she wields. This isn’t to say that any particular girl
cognizantly realizes this.
However, when ostracized from the collective, this capacity for consistently
attracting attention in a high degree makes her despised.</mark> Thus, women use attention not only for their own affirmation, individually and collectively, but also to do combat with each other. Far more damaging than physical fighting is the long term psychological impact of denying this
reinforcing satisfaction of attention.  Fun fact 😂 this is exactly why women will never be honest with each other on looks. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">most women  are literally incapable of committing to anything between 18-25 and not just because they’ve got some naive ideas in their head, but because 
they
literally just walked into the candy store ( due of her peak SMV ) , and they’re not about to leave with the first flavor they try , and they expect you to be commited and monogamous while you finally work your ass off , and get the chance to walk in to the candy store.</mark> </p>                                                                                                               


### The Epiphany phase

<p text align = "justify"> The popularized, ideal of a woman capitalizing on her prime earning years often excused as fulfilling her professional potential  is a primary contributor to this marriage postponement phenomenon, but it’s important to point out to men dating women in this phase that the last two years of the Party phase will be the stage at which a woman will begin to feel a more pressing urgency for long-term commitment. It’s during this phase ( 26 and 27) that women, with the foresight to see it, will make their best attempts to consolidate on marriage with the man who best personifies, or has the potential to personify, both Alpha sexual-genetics combined with the providership and parental investment that an optimized Hypergamy seeks to balance in the same man. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">At no other time will a woman feel more urgency in capitalizing on her still prime attractiveness and sexual agency with a man she believes will fulfill the dual dictates of
her sexual strategy. This is the most common phase in which a man will be asked “where is this going?” from a woman, or is delivered an ultimatum of withdrawal of intimacy (no more sex, or threats of break up) if no marriage proposal is forthcoming in the foreseeable future.
Although women’s preferred method of communication rests in the covert form, as she matures towards a condition of a lessened capacity to intrasexually compete with her younger peers (competition anxiety) most men discover that women in this demographic, by necessity, lean more on overt communication. </mark> During this period women will often make their first earnest attempts  ( if they can't find that one guy who can satisfy their optimized hypergamy ) to find ways sometimes by coercion  to ‘fix’ an Alpha into satisfying the Beta Bucks side of her Hypergamy equation, or, to seriously reevaluate an already committed Beta man’s potential to ‘Man Up’ and become more Alpha, be more ambitious and assesses (what she believes will be) his future SMV potential. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Lastly, bear in mind that women in this phase experience this urgency in indirect proportion to what their looks, sexuality and command of male attention will still afford them. It’s simple reasoning to figure that women who maintain their physical attractiveness and sexual agency, and are consistently rewarded for it with male attention, will prolong that state for urgency as long as possible. Thus, some attractive women may perpetuate their Party Years until such time as that attention abruptly ends.</mark>  Again, the epiphany isn’t about women hitting their SMV Wall during this phase (though it’s possible) it’s about a woman
conscientiously coming to terms with a markedly lessened capacity to sexually compete with her SMV-peak peers for the same male attention she enjoyed during her Party Years. Women absolutely (with commensurate effort) can and often do retain their looks and sexual agency past this phase; some into their late 30's and 40's.<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;"> However, what defines this phase is the conscious realization that their looks are no longer what they were in their prime.  women will broadcast several excuses such as  I was working on myself or I am more mature now ... either directly or indirectly, to men with a providership potential in the hopes of signaling to them that she is now ready to accept their feminine-preconditioned offers of love, loyalty and dependability offers which had been regularly forthcoming from men
in the past, but she had no use of in during her Party Years. some women in this decline phase may return to religious convictions  that they disregarded or abandoned in her Party Years. For other’s it may be some kind of self-enforced celibacy – a refusal to have sex under the Hypergamic
auspices of her Party Years in the hopes that a well provisioning male will appreciate her for her ‘new found’ prudence, so unlike how she used to be and all of the other girls who rejected him over the last decade.</mark></p>

### Transition phase

<p text align = "justify"> An exceptionally attractive 30 year old woman may in fact still be able to sexually select men above what most women her age can expect, however it’s what she believes about herself, her internalized expectations for her age and what the Party Years experience has or hasn’t taught her in this respect that contributes to this anxiety and urgency. As you may guess this self-assessment is also subject to the influences of social media and social conventions that pander to insulating her from reality and build-up her ego.  The imperative of scoial conventions is to convince  a man of such before he comes to a full realization of his peak sexual market value, and thus locking him up in a comittment. Men in such an awareness of their own SMV become a threat to women’s control of their own Hypergamy.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">The Cardial rule of sexual Strategies :- For one gender’s sexual strategy to succeed the other gender must compromise or abandon its own. </mark> 
<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">From a biological perspective men’s sexual imperative is one of unlimited
access to unlimited sexual availability.</mark> This isn’t to discount the very strong
impulse in men to seek assurances of paternity in the children they
ultimately sire, however, prior to his parental investment, the male impetus
is to seek unlimited access to unlimited sexuality.
<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">When we consider a male sexual imperative in the biological respect, and
the strategies men use to effect it, it becomes easier to understand the social
conventions and engineering the Feminine Imperative uses to control and
maximally restrict men as sexual selectors  </mark> when a woman spends most of her twenties living in a committed, monogamous relationship while listening to the sexual escapades and complaints of her single friends,  her Epiphany Phase will become her one last chance where she realizes she's missed out on certain things in life. This phase is often marked by a desire for a second chance, which often takes the form of divorce fantasies. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">A relationship based on a man acquiescing to a woman’s ultimatum ( such as marry me or we will break up or weaponizing sex) fundamentally corrupts the Frame and future of that marriage / relationship. Agreeing to an ultimatum is both negotiated desire and a permanent impression of your Beta status to a woman. One of the primary tenets of my Game philosophy is that true desire cannot be negotiated. A natural, unsolicited desire state, unmitigated by obligation
or concerns for resources exchange, is the ideal basis for any intergender relationship. Any factors that introduce elements that hinder this genuine desire – exchange, negotiations, obligations, reciprocity, etc. – weaken this desire and weaken the relationship.</mark>  <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">when a beta man encounters an interest from a woman in her epiphany phase , he may believe that her interest in him is genuine and based on a true connection. However, the attraction that the woman feels towards him is born out of necessity, rather than genuine interest. That necessity is the need to consolidate on monogamy and long term commitement with a man who’ll willingly ignore not just her past Alpha Fucks indiscretions, but participate in what he’s been conditioned to believe is his duty as a man from society and start to build a “mature adult” life with her. once he get's in her hands  she will get pregnant to further consolidate the long term provisioning.</mark>
</p>

### The Security Phase

<p text align = "justify">It’s essentially a man’s proven capacity to provide enough resources for himself and a potential mate (and future family) that are key to this attraction. These are
qualities an SMV peaked man is socially expected to possess, and socially expected to deliver for a woman precisely at the time in which she finds herself the most necessitous of these qualities and provisioning (29-31 years of age).  <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">During the Security Phase, affluence, provisioning capacity and the status that should be associated with it become a primary attractant for women. The want for physical appeal and arousal cues are still an important factor in attraction, but indicators of maturity, affluence, and other intrinsic
qualities become a priority. That isn’t to say a random short term mating
opportunity with an arousing Alpha would be ignored (especially around
her ovulation cycle), but long-term security takes precedence</mark>. Many older women will tell themselves that their experience, maturity, accomplishments and financial stability mean
they should be way more valuable to men seeking wives than some
young babe on the take. Of course, they have to tell them-selves this
because reality isn’t making it easy to believe. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">But the men the 31-34 year old women really want are the
older, established men who will give them a marriage proposal and a
family. This is why it is counterintuitively harder to game the older
woman who still retains a vestige of her youthful attractiveness: she
wants and expects so much more than the younger woman.</mark></p>
#### <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">The Turning point</mark>

<p text align = "justify">Once the first (or possibly second) child arrives, a woman’s order of
intimate priorities changes or “turns” to that of the child. The sex “reward”,
the ‘cookie time for good boy’, for desired behavior or performance ‘turns’
off, or sex is used as an intermittent reward for desired behavior (doing domestic chores (cooking , cleaning ) ).  Farthermore, she starts comparing him to other men and the ghosts of the Alphas she
knows or has known. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Sex becomes a utility; a positive reinforcer for her Beta’s increasing of his
provisioning capacity rather than the true, visceral enjoyment she had with
her past lovers or possibly the younger version of her husband.</mark> Again, he
meets with ready-made social conventions that shame his discontent.
“Is sex all that’s important to you? It shouldn’t be, because it’s really what’s
on the inside that counts”, but he can’t shake the feeling he’s slipping out of
her respect. This does not mean all marriages and relationships follow this schedule. but it’s important that men know the signs, understand what’s really
expected of them and know when they’re being settled on despite all a
woman’s self-interested refutations of that. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">It’s important that he lives in his own Frame and that any woman, wife or
otherwise, participates in his Frame at his pleasure. Beta men rarely have
those expectations because they begin from a position of scarcity and a preconditioned
responsibility to forgive a woman’s sexual strategy while still
being gushingly appreciative that she chose him to settle on</mark></p>

### The Reassessment Phase

<p text align = "justify">The more an Alpha man actualizes his SMV potential – through maintained
(or improved) looks, career, maturity, affluence, status, etc. – the more a
woman’s need for enduring security becomes threatened as her SMV
consistently decays in comparison to his. A woman’s logical response to
this new form of competition anxiety usually manifests in two ways.  the first one is placing herself in a dominant role in the relationship and  The second logical response is resentment. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;"> After her kids are
at, or almost at an age of real independence, The binding, cooperative arrangements of childrearing that necessitated her
drive for security gradually decrease in importance, giving way to a new
urgency
– pairing with someone “she really connects with” before her (adjusted for
age) SMV / looks are entirely spent on the provider male she now loathes (hates)
the idea of spending a future with. That Beta has served his usefulness and
now she realizes what she really needed all along was a man who she has a
true respect for under the conditions that her maturity has at last made her
aware of</mark>.</p>
## Hierarchies of love


<p text align = "justify"> <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Women are utterly incapable of loving a man in the way that a man
expects to be loved</mark>. There is no universally right or wrong way to love someone, but rather the issue arises when one fails to acknowledge and understand the different ways in which men and women perceive love. Men often assess their ability to love based on concepts such as honor and justice, whereas women tend to focus on loving a man for who he is before they can fully value his qualities. When individuals fail to recognize these differences, they may unintentionally punish themselves by expecting too much from their partner or failing to meet their partner's unique needs for affection True romance must be natural and willingly reciprocated by both parties involved. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Before the rise of feminine social primacy, men didn't think too much about how they expressed love towards their wives and children. They naturally assumed a role of protecting, providing for, and taking care of them without consciously considering it. In addition, there wasn't as strong of a desire for an equal exchange of love between partners like there is today. These values evolved over time due to both biological and societal factors. Before the rise of feminine primacy, men expressed their love by providing support and guidance rather than receiving it in return. However, as women gained more freedom, this traditional understanding of gender roles shifted. In an attempt to make men more like women, the idea of love centered around male support and guidance was replaced with a new model based on feminine values. This has resulted in confusion about what masculinity means, and has caused men to lose touch with a core aspect of their identity. </mark> While a woman’s respect, and a degree of love may flow back to her man, her primary love and concern is directed towards her children. Beyond the rigors of physically gestating a child, raising children
to self-sufficiency required a considerable investment of effort and
resources – not to mention constant attention. Nature selected-for women
with an innate, biological and psychological capacity to nurture and direct
love primarily towards their offspring.  women's love model is based u
pon what you are rather than who you are. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> In today's society, where Hypergamy has been given free reign, it is no longer men’s provisioning that dictates a woman’s predisposition to want to be a
submissive partner in their relationships. To an increasingly larger degree
women no longer depend upon men for the provisioning, security and
emotional support that used to be a buffer against their innate Hypergamous
impulses. since they make thier own money. Consequently, this has led to a decrease in the importance of male provisioning. As a result, women increasingly seek partners based on fulfilling their innate desire for "Hypergamy. The demand for
Men who meet women’s increasingly over-estimated sense of Hypergamic
self-worth ( status and affluence )makes the men women could submit to a precious commodity,
and increases further stress on the modern sexual market place. Women can
handle making more money in a relationship, but they despise being the
leader in a relationship.</mark> </p>          




## Conditioning

<p text align = "justify">One of the first things men are made aware of when they come into a Red
Pill awareness is their own predisposition to pedestalize a woman they’re
interested in. it's really less about respect and more about culling intimate approval from
girls (i.e. The Savior Schema). When this tendency to pedestalize is paired with a scarcity
mentality and a learned soul-mate romanticism, this can develop into a state
of ONEitis a man will have for a woman.  this tendency is a deeply internalized
aspect of a man’s earliest conditioning. Pedestalization conditioning can be learned in the home, but commonly it’s school, church, the media and popular culture.  the popular understanding of chivalry, particularly as it relates to men's behavior towards women, is a distorted and romanticized version of its original intended purpose. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">The concept of chivalry was meant to be a code of ethics for knights and soldiers to abide by, established by the Roman Catholic Church in medieval times. However, over time it has been twisted into something that reinforces gender roles and expectations rather than promoting honorable behavior for all. There were similar codes in feudal Japan known as Bushido. chivalry served a similar purpose to feminism by indirectly supporting women's interests through promoting the idea of courtly love. The concept of courtly love encouraged men to express their romantic feelings towards women with grand gestures , sacrifices and expensive gifts to again prove of ones worth and sincerity to her. This idea allowed women to wield indirect power over men and influence their behavior through their acceptance or rejection of these expressions of love. What women and feminine-conditioned men find offensive about the Red
Pill is that it challenges the conditioned ego-investments they depend upon
to operate in a feminine primary social order. Women are of course
naturally threatened by men becoming too aware of the latent role this order
conditions them for and expects them to play to best optimize their sexual
selection options and strategy. The more men aware of this strategy, the
likelier they are not to cooperate in a strategy that doesn’t hold their true
best interests.</mark>. I’m sure those men knew of the consequences of allowing women to
control their fates. I’m sure there were Beta men and cuckolded men as
well, but even the wisest Alpha among them could never, for instance,
understand the impact that a unilaterally feminine-controlled form of birth
control would effect upon a global-ized society. When I do consults with men of all ages I have to begin from a presumption
that these men’s concept of masculinity is usually the result of a deliberate
attempt by the Feminine Imperative to confuse men about what being a man
should mean to him.</p>
