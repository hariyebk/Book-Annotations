## The Road to wealth has a shortcut

<p text align = "justify"> There's a hidden road to wealth and financial freedom, a shortcut of blinding speed where you can achieve wealth in youthful exuberance over elder entropy.
Yes, you don't have to settle for mediocrity. You can live rich, retire four decades
early, and live a life that most can't. Sadly, the shortcut is cleverly camouflaged
from your view. Instead of the shortcut, you're led down a paralyzing road to
mediocrity-a dulled cornucopia of financial stratagem tailored to the slumbering
masses, a legion of mandates that sacrifices your wildest dreams in favor of
numbed expectations. That road?
It's financial mediocrity, known as “Get Rich Slow,” “The Slowlane,” or “Wealth
in a Wheelchair.” That tedium sounds like this: Go to school, get good grades,
graduate, get a good job, save 10% of your paycheck, invest in the stock market,
max your 401(k), slash your credit cards, and clip coupons... then, someday,
when you are, oh, 65 years old, you might get rich. This dictation is a decree to trade life, for life. It's the long way, and no, it isn't scenic. If wealth were an ocean voyage, “Get Rich Slow” would be sailing around the horn of South America, while the Fastlaner uses the shortcut-the
Panama Canal. The fastlane is a complete psychological and mathematical formula that cracks the code to wealth and unlocks the gateway to the shortcut. The Fastlane is a progression of distinctions that gives probability to the unspeakable: Live richly today while young, and decades before standard norms of retirement. Yes, you can win a lifetime of freedom and prosperity, and
it doesn't matter if you're 18 or 40. “Get Rich Slow” criminally asks you
to trade your freedom for freedom. It's an insanely outrageous barter and a dream
destroyer. Every month I earn thousands of dollars from passive incomes  and appreciation on investments working around the globe. No matter what I do on any day, one thing is sure: I get paid and I do not have to work. the Fastlane is like a yellow brick road paved in psychology
and mathematics that put the odds of massive wealth in your favor.

## Distinctions


+ What they teach doesn't work, but selling it does.
+ Believing that old age is a precursor to retirement is the real BS.
+ Get rich slow's success is nefariously dependent on too many factors you can not control.
+ salary is a drug they give you , to forget about your dreams.
+ Normal is not something to aspire to, it's something to get away from.
+  College was a five-year prenatal employee brainwashing with graduation as the overrated climax.
+ wealth creation for a Fastlane entrepreneur operates under an exponential scale those who hold jobs operate under a linear scale. 

+ I  countinued to automate my website and processes and then steady transformation took place. I worked less and less. Suddenly, I worked an hour a day instead of ten. Yet, the money rolled in. I'd go to Vegas on a gambling spree; the money rolled in. I'd be sick for four days; the money rolled in. I'd day trade for a month; the money rolled in. I'd take a month off; the money rolled in. Then I realized what I achieved. This was the Fastlane. I built myself a real, living, fruit-bearing money tree. 
+ If you try to skip process, you'll never experience events. Unfortunately, as a media-driven, “I want it now” society, we spotlight and glorify the event, but usher the process behind the woodshed, carefully drying its sweat from the public cognition.
+ Expect a price to be paid. Expect risk and sacrifice. Expect bumps in the road. There is no wisdom or personal growth gained in a journey that someone else does for you.

## Roadmaps

<p text align = "text align">If you want to change your life, change your choices. To change your choices you must change your belief system. Beliefs are powerful mechanisms that drive action, whether true or not.  Your belief system acts like a roadmap, a compass that, if errant, can lead you to a lifetime of detours. Fictitious beliefs are lying roadmaps; they escort you to down dead-end roads.  Within these three roadmaps lies a psychology, a belief system that dictates
actions relative to each roadmap. and More importantly, each roadmap operates
within a “universe” governed by a mathematical  “wealth equation.  Whichever financial roadmap you follow will predispose you to the  a specific destination.  those predispositions are the sidewalk to poorness , the slow lane to mediocrity and the fast lane to wealth.
</p>
### The side walk

<p text align = "justify"> 
On the Sidewalk, you're always “one something” from being homeless,
bankrupt, or back living in your parent's basement.
Yes, some Sidewalkers actually earn large incomes, but none of them ever
obtains true wealth. Don't let the contradiction fool you. A Sidewalker's financial destination doesn't exist. The plan is to have no plan. money is immediately spent on the next great gadget, the next trip, the next newer car, the next fashionable styles, or the next hot fad. no saving or no investments. Sidewalkers are the majority and instant gratification is thier song. You can't medicate poor money management with more money. If you don't want to work at Kmart until you're 75 years old or you don't want to retire under a bridge in a cardboard box, you have to have a plan. Should life grant you another 50 years, what the heck is
your plan?  the more you try to look rich while you can't truely afford it , the tighter the grip of poorness becomes. 
</p>


#### Lifestyle servitude

<p text align = "justify">Used properly, money buys freedom, and freedom is one parcel in the wealth
trinity. Freedom buys choices. Money buys the freedom to watch your kids grow up.
Money buys the freedom to pursue your craziest dreams. Money buys the freedom to build and strengthen relationships. it secures one agent of the wealth formula, freedom, which is a powerful
guardian to wealth's sibling ingredients: health and relationships. There are many millionaires and well paid career folks who are absolutely miserable, and it has nothing to do with the money. It has to do with their freedom. Money owns them, instead of them owning their money.  I learned about Lifestyle Servitude in my early 20s. After college graduation, I
took a hellacious job as a construction laborer in Chicago and fought city traffic
daily. The pay was more than I had ever earned at my young age, and with my
increase in income, I felt wealthy. So what did I do? I elevated my lifestyle and
financed the illusion of wealth. I bought my first sports car, a Mitsubishi
3000GT.
It didn't take long for me to realize that my dream car wasn't an icon of wealth,
but a parasite that fed on my freedom. I hated my job, it was stressful, and it
drained my energy, leaving my entrepreneurial dreams tethered. I couldn't quit. I
had responsibilities: car payments, gas, and insurance. Because of my
obligations to “stuff,” I had sentenced myself to imprisonment in a job I loathed.
Yet, this type of servitude is normal. We're taught to strive for the latest and
greatest regardless of consequence. It leaves us indentured for years,
condemning us to lifestyle imprisonment… and the more stuff you buy that you
can't afford, the longer your jail sentence becomes. Think about the last time you bought a pack of gum. Did you fret over the price?
Did you ask, “Hmmm, can I afford this?” Probably not. You bought the gum and
it's done. The purchase had no impact on your lifestyle or your future choices. To
a rich man who walks into a dealership and buys a six-figure Bentley without
thought, the acts are the same. Affordability is when you don't have to think
about it. If you have to think about “affordability,” you can't afford it because
affordability carries conditions and consequences.  Would you regret a gum purchase if you lost your job a week later? Or if your sales forecast was slashed by 50%? Nope,
it wouldn't make a difference. This is how affordability is measured against your
level of wealth. If you can't immunize yourself from the temptations of
instant gratification, you'll be hard pressed to find success in either health or
wealth. Both demand a lifestyle shift from short-term thinking (instant
gratification) to long-term thinking (delayed gratification).

 <p text align = "justify">Mark Cuban, billionaire entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks NBA
team a telling tale of luck in regards to his
success. Mark recalls the struggles of his early successes before his big sale to
Yahoo for $5.9 billion. In each story, Mark remembers how people attributed his
success to luck … lucky to sell his first company, MicroSolutions … lucky to
make money trading in the technology boom … and lucky to sell his company to
Yahoo for a few billion. Notice how events are quickly reasoned to be luck and
process is swept underneath the rug.
Cuban understands the dichotomy that most don't: Process creates events that
others see as luck. He goes on to comment how nobody mentioned luck when it
came time to reading complicated software texts or Cisco router manuals or
sitting in his house testing and experimenting with new technologies. Where was
luck then?  While luck can create riches by way of lotteries,
casinos, and rich parents, it rarely creates long-lasting wealth. To take advantage
of The Millionaire Fastlane understand that luck is a product of process, action,
work, and being “out there.” And when you are “out there” you stand a chance at
being in the right place at the right time. </p>

#### Take Responsibility for your circumstances.

<p text align = "justify">If the landlord raised your rent, is it his fault you decided to live there and you didn't read the lease agreement? If the company laid you off, is it their fault you chose to work there? Was it my fault that I was a broke 25-year-old stuck in a blizzard in a limo on the side of the road? It was. admit it's your faults that lead you to the place that you are currently in and take the driver's seat of your own life. the world doesn't owe you sympathy. you chose to be where you want to be. Most bad situations are consequences of bad choices. Own them and you own your life. It's easy to be “responsible” when being responsible means just walking away. Accountability is  modifying your behavior that made you to choose the the bad choise. Taking responsibility is the first step to taking the driver's seat of your life.Accountability is the final.The Fastlane is about control. </p>

### The Slow lane  

<P text align = "justify">Wealth is best lived young and enjoyed while you have health, vibrancy, energy, and yes, maybe even some hair. Wealth is best lived in the prime of your life, not
in its twilight after 40 years of 50-hour workweeks have pulverized your dreams
into surrender. Deep in our soul we know this, yet we continue to faithfully
pledge obedience to a financial roadmap that promises wealth after four or five
decades. And the bigger concern you should have is, does it even work? The plan is a failure because the plan is based on time and factors you can't control. A strategy that requires your life and your dreams to be paid as penance is a sucker's bet. The Slowlane arrogantly assumes that you will live forever and, of course, be gainfully employed forever. Unfortunately, wheelchairs don't fit in the trunks of Lamborghinis. While coupons and other Slowlane strategies
aren't worthless in a plan, they shouldn't be the plan. The Slowlane as a total
plan is the problem, not the Slowlane being a part of a plan. This distinction is
critical because financial discipline must transcend to any wealth campaign. Have You Sold Your Soul for a Weekend? Have you become so numbed by making a living that the living has been sucked out of your life? Are you so blinded by Monday through Friday that any beauty
that sings before you is muted? The train commuters in lodon's train station experiment come and go like zombies they're oblivious to the splendor of Monday through Friday. Yet, what if this
experiment occurred on Saturday; would its outcome be any different ? Life does not begin on Friday night and end Monday morning.  A friend recently berated me because I declined to go out on a Saturday night.“ Are you crazy? It's Saturday night!” he wailed. I told him something a Slowlaner doesn't understand: For me, every day is a Saturday because I haven't sold off
Monday through Friday. When you accept the Slowlane roadmap as your strategy, you accept 5-for-2. You give five days of work servitude in exchange for two days of weekend
freedom. Yes, Monday through Friday is prostituted for Saturday and Sunday.
While people easily recognize and reject a negative 60% return on their money,
they do it willingly with their time. Five days of servitude for two days of freedom is not a good
trade unless you trade time into a system that can give you a better return on
your time. Instead of 5-for-2 for life, how about a 5-for-2 trade that has the
potential to blossom into a better ratio? Like 1-for-2 or 3-for-10? Would you
make a 5-for-2 trade knowing that it could transform into a 1-for-10? Would that
be a something to invest in? While I worked my plan, I gave 7-for-0 (I worked seven days and didn't take a day off) because I knew the roads on my roadmap converged with dreams. I
worked for a better ratio in the near future, not in 40 years. I controlled my
destiny and eventually my time trade investment yielded a dividend of 40 years.
Now I do 0-for-7. If work zero days and get seven days of freedom. If I'm cold-calling out of the damn phonebook, it won't be for my boss, but for me. Who taught us that trading time in exchange for money was a great idea ? Wouldn't it make sense to get paid regardless of what you're doing? Get paid while you sleep, while you have fun, while you poop, while you sit on the
beach? Why not get paid with the simple passage of time and make time work
for you instead of against you? Does that exist? It does, but it doesn't come from
a Slowlane.</p>
#### Uncontrolled limited leverage


<p text align = "justify"> Why is ULL so important? To accumulate financial wealth, you need to attract large sums of money. To attract large sums of money, you need two things: 
1) Control and 2) Leverage. The Slow lane has neither and that truth is exposed
when you reverse engineer the strategy into its mathematical equivalent, or its
wealth universe. Uncover the mathematics behind the plan and you uncover its
weakness! When the Slow lane is deconstructed, you find two variables: 1) The “primary
income source,” which defines how income is earned, and 2) The “wealth
accelerator,” which defines how wealth is accumulated. The Slow lanner's primary
income source comes from “a job,” while the wealth acceleration vehicle comes
from “market investments” like 401(k)s and mutual funds. Put it together and
you arrive at the Slow lanner's wealth equation: WEALTH = (Job) + (Market Investments). Intrinsic value is what you earn working a job. How much is someone willing to pay you for what you offer to society? Intrinsic value is the value of your time set by the marketplace. Intrinsic value is measured in units of time, either hourly or annually. If you're paid
$10/hour to flip burgers at the neighborhood grill, your intrinsic value is $10 per
hour. If you're an accountant and earn a $120,000 annual salary, your intrinsic
value is $120,000 per year. your intrinsic value is directly correlated with how much valuable skills you acquire. intrinsic value is measured in units of TIME. Can you control time? Can you leverage time? You can’t Your time is limited to 24 hours of exchange. If you earn $200/hour, you
can’t miraculously demand to work 400 hours in one day. If you earn
$50,000/year, you can’t miraculously demand to work 400 years in your life.
Time has no leverage. Behind limited leverage is another corrosive wealth killer—no control. Can
you control your employer? Can you control your salary? Can you control the
economy? Can you earn $50,000 one year and next year bank $50 million?
Can you control anything about your job, including your measly 4% pay
raise? <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">wealth requires you to have something that works for you day and night ,7 days a week, 365 days a year. let's say you got 1000 employees for your company, In this case Time is leverage because you have bought other people's time and A day for you is not just 24 hours but 24 * 1000 = 24,000 hours. The more employees you have, the bigger your leverage gets and the faster you become wealthy. Another example can be owning A software that runs all day without requiring you to be there. It's like a money making machine. you can multiply your efforts without involving other humans and without needing money from other humans with the help of code and the internet.  large numbers require leverage of time. Every day, people sacrifice their time for tiny nuggets of wealth, where time is the liability and not the asset. Anything that steals time and doesn't have the power to free time is a liability. You might increase your intrinsic value by learning a new skill But No matter how much money you charge for your time You can only work 24 hours a day. you don't have leverage. businesses like consulting and mentorship are also like employment , In order to get paid you need to spend your time. </mark> .  At some point, the Slowlaner realizes he can't force the stock market to yield
bigger returns. He can't force a 200% pay raise. He can't afford an advanced
education to raise intrinsic value. Job-hopping offers little incremental pay
upgrades. The Slowlaner is enslaved to his equation and resorts to manipulating
the only controllable variable, personal net income, which is increased by
reducing expenses.</p>

#### Education Servitude

<p text align = "justify"> While the Side walker deals with “Lifestyle Servitude,” the Slow lanner wrestles with “Education Servitude” (freedom eroded by education) that traps the victim
to a job. Has your education indentured you to a job?  This kind of debt buries the dreams of your youth and puts them permanently bound to the Slowlane or worse, the Sidewalk. A typical
collegiate study progresses from general knowledge to very specific skill sets.
For example, while studying finance I learned complex mathematical formulas
that aided in financial decision-making, things like “lease or buy” and “return on
investment.” These concepts are specific tools to a trade that can hinder your
future options. If there aren't opportunities in my field, my
education becomes marginalized and devalued. If the opportunities available
require less education(say, a BS) than I have (MBA), I become overqualified and
unemployable. If my skills erode in practicality based on technological
evolution, my education becomes deprecated and my value to society plummets
accordingly. If you financed your advanced education with debt, the debt automatically
becomes parasitic and traps you into forced job servitude, and that destroys
freedom. </p>

#### How to Win the Slow lane: The “Secret Exit”



<p text align = "justify"> The Slow lane can be defied if you find its “secret exit,” its “get out of jail free” card that neutralizes the limitations of Uncontrollable Limited Leverage. That
secret Slow lane escape? Fame. Fame breaks the mathematical limitations of intrinsic value. People pay extraordinary rates for you and your services. the limitations of the Slow lane roadmap are shattered because intrinsic value explodes. Suddenly, intrinsic value has leverage because of demand. You can defy the Slow lane's limitations by becoming so
indispensable that your value to society skyrockets. If millions seek you, you
will be paid millions. Pro basketball player LeBron James is paid millions
because his skills are in short supply. Famous actors and entertainers are paid
millions because millions demand their brand in entertainment form. Extreme
talent is paid extremely well.  The other highly sought-after Slow lane “secret exit” is good corporate management. When a corporate CEO cashes $20 million in stock options, you've witnessed another Slow lane defiance. Surely you've heard about all those overpaid CEOs
of large companies raking in the big dough. Have you ever looked at their age?
Exclusive of the founders and owners, most of them are in their 50s and 60s.
Obviously, the roads through corporate management don't happen overnight;
from mailroom to CEO can take 40 years. And if it does, you certainly don't get
there by taking it easy. Nope, you arrive early and leave late</p>


### The Fastlane

<p text align = "justify">The Industrial Revolution was a historic period when humans learned how to leverage the speed and efficiency of machine-based manufacturing. Manual
labor was replaced in favor of systems, an organized union of distinct parts that
coalesced into a specific production outcome. Long and arduous tasks manually
handled by humans transformed into mechanization, The default road to wealth is manual labor, a fight against time and intrinsic value. The rapid road to wealth is to industrialize the wealth
process, to systematize it like our ancestors systematized production. The
differences between the default road (the Slow lane) and the shortcut (the
Fastlane) are best demonstrated in an Egyptian parable. 
</p>

##### The Parable of Fastlane Wealth

<p text align = "justify"> 
A great Egyptian pharaoh summons his two young nephews, Chuma and Azur,
and he commissions them to a majestic task: Build two monumental pyramids as
a tribute to Egypt. Upon completion of each nephew's pyramid, Pharaoh
promises each an immediate reward of kingship, retirement amidst riches, and
lavish luxury for the rest of their natural lives. Additionally, each nephew must
construct his pyramid alone. Chuma and Azur, both 18, know their daunting task will take years to complete. Nonetheless, each is primed for the challenge and honored by the Pharaoh's
directive. They exit Pharaoh's chambers ready to begin the long pyramid building
process. Azur begins work immediately. He slowly drags large heavy stones into a square
formation. After a few months, the base of Azur's pyramid takes shape.
Townsfolk gather around Azur's constructive efforts and praise his handiwork.
The stones are heavy and difficult to move, and after one year of heavy labor,
Azur's perfect square foundation to the pyramid is nearly finished.
But Azur is perplexed. The plot of land that should bear Chuma's pyramid is
empty. Not one stone has been laid. No foundation. No dirt engravings. Nothing.
It's as barren as it was a year ago when Pharaoh commissioned the job.
Confused, Azur visits Chuma's home and finds him in his barn diligently
working on a twisted apparatus that resembles some kind of human torture
device. building Pharaoh a pyramid and you spend your days locked in this barn fiddling
with that crazy machine?”
Chuma cracks a smile and says, “I am building a pyramid, leave me alone.”
Azur scoffs, “Yeah, sure you are. You haven't laid one stone in over a year!”
Chuma, engrossed and unfazed by his brother's accusation retorts, “Azur, you're
short-sightedness and thirst for wealth have clouded your vision. You build your
pyramid and I will build mine.”
As Azur walks away, he chides, “You fool! Pharaoh will hang you in the gallows
when he discovers your treason.”
Another year passes and Azur solidifies the base of his pyramid and begins the
second level. Except a problem arises. Azur struggles in his progress. The stones
are heavy and he cannot raise them to the pyramid's second level. Challenged by
his physical limitations, Azur recognizes his weakness: he needs more strength
to move heavier stones, and to do so, seeks the counsel of Bennu, Egypt's
strongest man. For a fee, Bennu trains Azur to build bigger and stronger
muscles. With great strength, Azur anticipates the heavier stones will be easier to
lift onto the higher levels.
Meanwhile, Chuma's pyramid plot of land is still barren. Azur assumes his
brother has a death wish since, by all appearances, Chuma is violating Pharaoh's
mandate. Azur forgets about his brother and his nonexistent pyramid.
Another year passes and Azur's pyramid construction slows to a disheartening
crawl. It often takes one month just to place one stone. Moving stones to the
upper levels require great strength and Azur spends much of his time working
with Bennu to build greater strength.
Additionally, Azur is spending most of his money on counseling fees and the
exotic diet required for the training. Azur estimates at his current construction. pace, his pyramid will be completed in another 30 years. Unfazed, Azur lauds,
“After three years, I've far surpassed my brother. He hasn't placed one stone yet!
That fool!”
Then, suddenly, one day while hauling a heavy stone up his pyramid, Azur hears
a loud commotion erupting from the town square. The townsfolk, regular
observers to his work, abruptly abandon his plot to examine the celebratory fuss.
Curious himself, Azur takes a break and leaves to investigate.
Surrounded by a cheering crowd, Chuma trolls up the town square
commandeering a 25-foot contraption, a towering machine built from a twisted
maze of gantries, wheels, levers, and ropes. As Chuma slowly moves up the
village street amidst the buoyant crowd, Azur fears the explanation. After a short
trawl to Chuma's barren pyramid plot, Azur's suspicions are confirmed.
Within minutes, Chuma's strange machine starts moving heavy stones and begins
to lay the foundation to his pyramid. One after another, the machine effortlessly
lifts the stones and softly places them side-by-side into place. Miraculously, the
machine requires little effort for Chuma's operation. Crank a wheel attached to a
rope and cantilever entwined by a gear system, and bingo! Heavy stones are
moved quickly and magically.
While Azur's pyramid foundation took over a year to build, Chuma lines up the
foundation to his pyramid within one week. The second level that Azur so
arduously struggled with is even more shocking: Chuma's machine does the
work 30 times quicker. What took Azur two months takes Chuma's machine two
days. After 40 days, Chuma and his machine accomplish as much as Azur's three
years of toilsome work.
Azur was destroyed. He spent years doing the heavy lifting while Chuma built a
machine to do it for him.
Instead of honoring the machine, Azur vows, “I must get stronger! I must lift
heavier stones!” Azur continues the hard labor of pyramid building while Chuma
continues to work the crank of his machine.
After eight years, Chuma finishes his pyramid at age 26: three years to build the
system and five years to reap the benefits of the system. The great pharaoh is
pleased and does as promised. He rewards Chuma with kingship and endows
him with great riches. Chuma never has to work another day in his life.
Meanwhile, Azur continues to dredge away at the same old routine. Lift rocks,
waste time and money to get stronger, lift rocks, and get stronger. Sadly, Azur
refuses to acknowledge his flawed strategy and endures the same old process:
Carry heavy stones until you can lift no more … then get stronger so you can lift
heavier stones. This mindless prescription leads Azur to a lifetime of toil. He never finishes his
pyramid promised to Pharaoh simply because he decides to do the heavy lifting
himself when he should have focused on a system to do it for him. Azur has a
heart attack and dies while on the 12th level of his pyramid, just two levels from
finishing. He never experiences the great riches promised by Pharaoh. Meanwhile, Chuma retires 40 years early in a crown of luxury. Sloshing in free
time, Chuma goes on to become Egypt's greatest scholar and an accomplished
inventor. He is entombed alongside Pharaoh in the same pyramid he built. 

The Slow lane is a job: your hard work traded for your employer's cash. Azur's
struggles resemble that of a Slowlaner; to get rich, you're told to get stronger
(spend money, return to school, and earn more in the job market) so you can lift
heavier stones. The Fastlane is about building a better system, a better
contraption, a better product, or a better “something” that will leverage your
work. In the Slow lane, you are the source of heavy lifting, while in the Fastlane,
you construct a system that does it for you.
</p>




##### Consumer Vs Producer

<p text align = "justify">
From the day you were born, you were baptized to play for Team Consumer,
from the Barbie Doll and the Tonka Truck to the Star Wars action figures.
You've been conditioned to demand: to want products, to need products, to buy
products, and of course, to seek out the cheapest of those products.
The correlation between the Slow lane and the Sidewalk is this: Jobs exist to
facilitate the consumer process. This “consumer” focus is like a
gravitational pull to keep you amenable to anti-Fastlane thinking. The winning team is Team Producer. Reshape life's focus on producing, not consuming. When you reframe your thinking from majority thinking (consumer) to minority thinking (producer), you effectively switch
teams and allegiances. Yes, become a producer first and a consumer second. I know; it's not easy. However, once you see the world from a producer
perspective, your perception sharpens like a fine-tuned radio frequency, from
static to clear stereo sound. Suddenly, opportunities have clarity, ideas surface,
and scams are exposed. This new minority status is critical to strengthening your
wealth creation temperament. Remember, the rich are a minority, and you want
to be in that minority. It starts with a producer mindset. When you encounter an advertising message that coaxes you to buy something, examine it from the producer perspective. How does this company make money? What is the aim of its message? What kind of business processes are involved in offering this product or service? Is this company making a profit? What is the
revenue model? Is this product manufactured overseas or locally? </p>

<p text align = "justify"> This book is a
business system that has unlimited leverage in both time and money! First, it
survives time and it is capable of earning income long after my original time
investment. This book effectively transfers the act of income generation from me
(the human asset) to the book (the business asset).
From start to finish, this book cost roughly 1,000 hours of my time. If I sell
100,000 books at $5 profit each, I earn $500,000, or roughly $500 per hour
invested. If I sell 500,000 books, I will earn $2,500 per hour invested. The more
I sell, the greater the return on my original time investment, as I already paid the
time. Imagine 10 years from today I sell one copy of this book. Suddenly I earn
$5 from a time investment I made years ago! But it gets better! If I guest-speak on a radio show for 10 minutes and that appearance yields 1,000 book sales, this 10-minute investment yields $5,000 in income (1,000 books X $5 profit) and yields a return on my time at $30,000 per
hour. Unfortunately, many enthusiastic business owners engage in opportunities with
low, punitive speeds. For example, if you sit outside the hardware store and sell hot dogs from your hot dog cart, you've muzzled your speed with no accelerative leverage. The
variables are limited because your reach is confined to a small area. How many
hot dogs could you conceivably sell in the day? 40? 100? Is it possible you can
go home and rave to your wife “Honey! I sold 20,000 hot dogs today!” It would
never happen! Again, this isn't much different from the 24-hour cage on intrinsic
value. Small numbers have a strong gravity toward mediocrity.
</p> 

##### Asset value

Net Profit = (Units Sold) X (Unit Profit)

Asset Value = (Net Profit) X (Industry Multiplier)

<p text align = "justify">
Any time you have an asset that has sustainable profits, an industry multiplier
governed by prevailing market conditions determines the valuation of that asset.
Other people or companies will buy that asset based on the asset's net profit
multiplied by the assessed multiple. For example, in my particular Web space, industry multipliers ranged from 2 to 6. For this analysis, let's use the middle: 4. This means that any time I increased
my net profit, the value of my business increased by a minimum factor of 4, or
400%.

</p>

<p text align = "justify"> 
When your wealth is predicated on factors that you cannot control and that are
implicitly limited, you aren't going to make fast progress. You aren't in control,
because time is in control. You aren't in control, because the boss is in control.
You aren't in control, because the stock market is in control. How did I escape
these controls that society finds perfectly acceptable? Instead of trading my time
for money (manual labor), I traded it into a business system-industrialized
wealth production.

Real State can be considered as Fastlane wealth 1.0. For example, I own a single-family rental home with a great tenant. I could be living on the moon and each month I get a check in the mail because my time is detached from its income. Real estate is a perfect example of Wealth 1.0 because real estate is its own system. It is 95% passive. As time passes, tenants pay
landlords to use their property. Don't want to get involved in real estate? No problem. Rental systems aren't just reserved for real estate. Rental systems can come from a variety of other sources not real estate oriented. Leases, royalty payments, and licensing are other forms of “rental systems” that can produce reoccurring monthly income. For example, when you own the rights
to a music collection, corporations have to pay you a royalty to use the music.
The work might have been recorded decades earlier, but it still generates
royalties.

#Computer/Software-Systems (Passivity Grade: A-) ( Replication Grade: A+)

<p text align = "justify">
Computers are miraculous inventions and fertile seeds to money trees. They
work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and they don't bitch about working
conditions. They don't bitch that you don't pay them enough. They don't bitch
and moan about co-workers like Lazy Joan or Same-Shirt Bob.
Nope, computers aren't late, they don't ask for pay raises, and they don't care you
just bought a new Mercedes S-Class. Nope, they just do what they're
programmed to do and it's done. What sets the Internet apart from real estate is it
implicitly contains leverage. When you own a Web site, you're accessible to
millions. When you own a three bedroom home on Elm Street, it's accessible to a
few. Software enjoys plump margins because it is easily replicated. The marginal cost of it's replication is almost zero. Once the code is written, it's done. You can easily sell one or 10,000. Can you replicate an office building with ease? You can't. Software, when tapped into potent distribution, can be replicated to millions. It scales without significant degradation to passivity.
</p>
#Content-Systems (Passivity Grade: B+) ( Replication Grade: A-)

<p text align = "justify"> 
Content systems are systems of information. That information can be fused to a
variety of other systems, like the Internet and physical distribution systems. This
book is a content system that I can effectively move through other channels, like
the Internet or a book distributor. content like software, often has ease of replication. I can
print 10 million of these books. But I will never own 10 million pieces of real estate,
nor do I have any desire. Like their software counterparts, some of the richest
people on the planet are successful authors. JK Rowling, author and owner of the Harry Potter brand, went from being a 32-year-old divorced English teacher to a media mogul worth
over $400 million. The single mom has sold over 30 million copies of her books
in 35 different languages. Dan Brown has sold over 80 million copies of the DaVinci Code in 51
languages. Let me be perfectly clear: If you sell 80 million of ANYTHING, you
will be a very rich human being.  YouTube , Tiktok, Twitter are the new content systems. Change creates millionaires. Those who observe and take advantage of change will be the new millionaires and billionaires.  Content also survives time. This book might have taken me years to write, but it
also survives years. If someone buys this book five years from now, I will earn a
small profit on a time investment I made years earlier . </p>

#Distribution-Systems (Passivity Grade: B) ( Replication Grade: B-)

<p text align = "justify"> 
A distribution system is any structure or organization designed to move products
to the masses. If you sell your product to four
wholesale distributors that, in turn, sell it to retailers like Wal-Mart and Target,
you are leveraging a distribution system.
When inventing any product, the invention is always half the battle. Distribution
is the other. The greatest product in the world goes unused if it isn't leveraged
into the proper distribution system-either one that exists, or one that you create.
If you create a network marketing company to sell your new
vitamin product, you are creating a powerful distribution network capable of
earning millions. If you join a network marketing company, you are electing to
be a gear in the distribution process. A network marketing company, also known as a multi-level marketing (MLM) company, is a business model in which independent contractors or distributors are compensated based on their sales of a company's products or services, as well as the sales made by other distributors they have recruited into the company. In network marketing, distributors are typically required to buy a certain amount of product or pay a fee to join the company, and they earn a commission on their own sales as well as on the sales made by the people they have recruited into the company, called their "downline". The more people that a distributor recruits and the more sales that are made within their downline, the higher their potential earnings can be. As a network marketing company you transfer the risk of being left with unsold inventory from your shoulders to distributors.  This creates a powerful distribution network capable of earning millions. Savvy Fastlane entrepreneurs recognize that a successful
local business with weak leverage can be made highly leveraged by franchises or
chains. If your business operates in limited scale, it can be conquered with chains and franchises. If you own one hot-dog cart and sell at one location, there is no leverage. If you own 500 hot dogcarts and sell at 500 locations through 500 owner-operators, suddenly
leverage appears.

</p>

#Human-Resource-Systems (Passivity Grade: C) ( Replication Grade: C-)

<p text align = "justify"> 
Human resource systems are the most
expensive and complicated to run. Humans are unpredictable, expensive, and
difficult to control. Ask anyone with a company that relies on employees how
challenging its to keep employees happy. employees
need management. At a certain level, even managers need managers. Does this suggest that human resource systems are a drain to passivity? Mostly Yes. let me explain . If you own a coffee shop and work 80 hours a week, you have ZERO passivity. But if you have a General Manager who takes care of all , you could raise passivity by an estimated 40%. human resource systems are needed, because you can't do everything
yourself. </p>

#Lending-money (Passivity Grade: A) ( Replication Grade: C+-)

<p text align = "justify">

The best money tree inexistence sits right in your pocketbook: The good oldfashioned
buck. Yes, money. Money is the king of money trees.
How is money passive? If you have a lot of money, you're given the gate key to
switch teams from consumer to producer. Specifically, you move from borrower
to lender. You move from employee to employer. You move from customer to
owner. In other words, people pay you to use YOUR MONEY in the form of
interest or ownership. when you give your money to bank , you become a lender and earn passive income. since you can't control the interest rate Don't expect to build wealth by saving money. Fast lanners aren't using compound interest to build wealth, because it's not in their
wealth equation. The heavy lifting of wealth creation is left to their Fastlane
business. they use it to create income and liquidity. compound interest works best when you have large sums of money.

</p>

- The amount of money you have (or don't have) is a direct reflection on the amount of value you have provided (or not provided).
-  To exploit the Law of Effection, your business needs to make an impact of either **scale or magnitude, or both. Actually it's difficult to have both. If your profit (magnitude) is high , you will have small group of customers that can afford your product. If you want to have millions of customers , your should lower your profits.
-  Scale is making small Impact on Millions.  Unit sold 
- Magnitude is having a great impact on a few.  Unit profit
- If you can combine both scale and magnitude, we won't be discussing millions but billions
- The closer you get to the source of large numbers, the closer you will get to wealth. To serve millions is to make millions
-  If your primary income source comes from a job, your ability to pay yourself first is paralyzed because the governments are paid first!

<p text align = "justify"> The corporation serves as the Fastlane frame because it offers the immediate tax benefit of “pay yourself first” versus “pay yourself last.” When you own a
corporation, net profits are reduced by expenses. The remaining profit is taxed,
and those taxes are paid to the government. Additionally, corporations exist
separate from their owners and survive time. It's the surrogate structure that
serves as your business system. Any “adviser” who recommends a business structure as a sole
proprietorship or general partnership should be avoided like an airport toilet.
These entities are risky because they don't protect you and catapult unlimited
liability onto you and your personal assets.
If you're a plumber organized as a sole proprietor and you accidentally leave a
pipe cutter at a client's house and the client's three-year-old kills himself with it,
guess what? They're coming after you because you chose an ill-protected
business entity. Instead of suing a corporation, they sue you and everything you
own is up for grabs. </p>
## you are as you have chosen

<p text align = "justify">
Your life is the sum result of all the choices you
make, both consciously and unconsciously. If
you can control the process of choosing, you
can take control of all aspects of your life. You
can find the freedom that comes from being in
charge of yourself. If you aren't where you
want to be, the problem is your choices. Your circumstances are the symptoms of
those choices. Your choices spark the fires of future circumstances. It took me 26 years of life and a blizzard to grasp the horsepower of my choices. The blizzard impeded my limousine, but I was there because I chose it. I chose to get the job. I chose to pursue low-rent businesses. I chose to continue life in Chicago. I chose to avoid corporate after college. I chose my friends. I chose my
business pursuits. I chose all of it, and it engineered my life to that exact
moment. I awoke to the epiphany that I was the driver of my life and my
problems were the consequences of my choices. Wherever you are: reading on the train, on a plane, on the toilet in a run-down apartment, or on a beach in the Caribbean, you've chosen. I didn't force you to pick up this book and read it. You chose to. Yes, you are exactly where you
decide to be. And if that's unhappiness, you need to start making better choices by examining the past choices you made. Treasonous choices are actions that do irreparable harm to your life, your dreams, and your goals. The consequences of treasonous choices throw life onto unintended detours and hazardous roads that are difficult to escape and oftentimes, permanent. It's like tossing a life or death coin on yourself. Never Ever put yourself in this situations. You'd never
think that cheating on your wife could end so tragically. It did for Steve McNair
when his mistress allegedly shot him to death in a Nashville, Tennessee, condo.
While he didn't choose to be murdered, he chose to pursue that woman. He chose to lie to her. He chose the relationship. He chose to cheat. Your life's steering wheel ( your choices ) is a dangerous weapon. Three inches is all it takes. Jerk your life's wheel three tiny inches while speeding and you can steer your life onto a path of no return. Choices have this type of divergence over time and it's called “impact differential.” The divergence can be either positive or negative. For example, when I moved to Phoenix from Chicago, the “impact differential” exploded as time passed. Had I not made this choice,  my life would be significantly different. I also chose to get a dead-end job as a limo driver, which opened my eyes to a business need. That too was a choice that had extraordinary horsepower and created positive “impact differential.” Your choices have significant trajectory into the future, and the younger you are, the more horsepower they exude. Unfortunately, horsepower fades with age. If this is confusing, think about it in terms of an asteroid that is on a collision course with Earth. When an asteroid is millions of miles out in space
(representing your youthful choices) a simple one-degree change in trajectory
will save the Earth from destruction. This is the power of horsepower. For us
older folks, the asteroid is closer to Earth (and closer to our death), which
weakens the potency of our choices. A one-degree change isn't as effective, and
for the same potency, it needs to be 10 degrees. When you are under 25 you have maximum horsepower and your choices discharge an incredible amount of firepower. A simple choice I made more than 20 years ago is still felt today. That's a lot of torque! If you reflect on your
choices, you make them in an instant, yet their consequences transcend a lifetime, especially ones made early in life. if you knocked up some baby mama by age 23 and forced to start a family. How would that dictate your future life ? 

</p>

### The choice of perception

<p text align = "justify"> 
The first step in making better choices starts with your choice of perception ( Your belief system )  ,
because your actions evolve from those perceptions. If you lose your job, you
can frame it as a negative or a positive. When you're caught speeding, you can
be angry or thankful. The choice of perception and its choices start right between
your ears and drive themselves into choices of action. you might think $10,000 a month is a lot of
money! But for some Rich guy it's one night club expense. It was your perception and not reality. Earning $1 million in one month is possible if you make the right choices and drive the right Fastlane roads. This perception leads to better choices of action. Money is infinite. The goal of this book is to change your perception about wealth and money. Believe that retirement at any age is possible. Believe that old age is not a prerequisite to wealth. Believe that a job is just as risky as a business. Believe that the stock market isn't a guaranteed path to riches. Believe that you can be
retired just a few years from today. So how do you upload new beliefs and overwrite the old ones? Find the information, resources, and the people that align with the new beliefs. For
myself, I pursued the stories of those who acquired wealth fast and soon learned
that “Get Rich Quick” wasn't a myth.
 </p>

#Worse-Case-Consequence-Analysis (WCCA )

<p text align = "justify">
WCCA is designed to steer you away from perilous detours and treasonous
choices. Ask yourself these series of questions with complete honesty
1. What is the worst-case consequence of this choice?
2. What is the probability of it's outcome?
3. Is this an acceptable risk?

These questions expose potential disasters and alternatives can be chosen. Unnecessary
roads of treason can be bypassed.  For example, several years ago, after several drinks at
a local bar, I went home with a woman who was making the moves and wanted
to get busy. She pulled the old Harlequin whisper, “Make love to me.” Of course,
having known her for all of two hours, I knew this wasn't love but something
else. Behind my drunken passion, I ran through my WCCA analysis.
What is the worse case consequence of this choice?
1. I could get a sexually transmitted disease.
2. I could get her pregnant and be locked to this person for the rest of my life.
3. I could be falsely accused of rape.
What is the probability of these outcomes?
1. STD: 10% (based on her outward promiscuity!).
2. Pregnancy: 1%.
3. Falsely accused: 0.5%.
Is this an acceptable risk? I immediately reasoned HELL NO. The 10% or the
1%-I reasoned the risk was too great and that risk had outcomes that could
change my life FOREVER. I denied the woman's advances and hid my lust in
favor of a better choice.

</p>

### Headwinds

<p text align = "justify"> 
Going Fastlane and building momentum will require you to turn your back at the
people who fart headwinds in your direction. You have to break free of society's
gravitational force and their expectations. If you aren't mindful to this natural
gravity, life can denigrate into a viscous self-perpetuating cycle, which is
society's prescription for normal: Get up, go to work, come home, eat, watch a
few episodes of Law and Order, go to bed … then repeat, day after day after day.
Before you know it, 45 years have passed and you need another 25 just to make
your financial plan work. People who don't empower your goals are human headwind bloviators. They add friction to the journey. When you spout excitement over actions or ideas,
bloviators react with doubt and disbelief without reason and use conditioned talking points such
as, “Oh that won't work,” “Someone is already doing it,” and “Why bother? As a producer, you are the minority, while consumers are the rest. To be unlike “everyone” (who isn't rich), you (who will be rich) require a strong defense; otherwise, their toxicity infects your mindset. Commiserating with habitual, negative, limited thinkers is treasonous. Uncontrolled, these headwinds lead
directly to the couch and the video game console. Yes, the old, “If you hang out
with dogs, you get fleas.” People are like roads-they can either bring opportunity or distress into your life. Another headwind could be your work environment. If your hated job drains the life out of you, it's a headwind. After a long workday and you have nothing left
for your dreams and your Fastlane plan, you're done. The headwind keeps you
trapped.

</p>

### Time is the coin of Your life

<p text align = "justify">
Why will most people never get rich? Look no further than a $6 bucket of
chicken. It made big news: A major fast-food restaurant offered a free bucket of
chicken to anyone who had an Internet coupon. People flocked to restaurant
locations and waited for hours, all for a free $6 bucket of chicken. Know anyone
who would stand in line for hours just to get something free? What the hell is
wrong with people? I'll tell you: These people value their time at zero. It's free.
Like the air we breathe, they're convinced that time is abundant and in endless
supply. They live as if they were immortal. They are certain that time, the fuel of
their life, never runs empty. Value your time poorly and you will be poor. Take a look around. How do your friends, family, and peers value their time? Are they standing in line to save four bucks? Are they driving 40 minutes to save 10 dollars? Are they parked on the sofa anxiously waiting to see who wins Dancing With the Stars? The average American watches more than four hours of TV each day. In a 65- year life, that person will have spent nine years glued to the tube. Why? Simple.
Life sucks. Life needs an escape. Life is no good. Show me someone who spends hours online playing Mafia Wars or Farmville, and I'll show you someone who probably isn't very successful. When life sucks, escapes are sought. There are two types of time that will make up your lifespan: Your free time and your indentured time. “Free time” is yours to spend as you please: TV, a jog in the park, video games, sleeping, eating, vacation. If you're like most, your free time is lumped on
evenings and weekends, where time is not exchanged for money. “Indentured time” is the opposite: It's the total time spent earning money and the consequences of that spent time. When you awake in the morning, shower, dress, drive to the train station, wait, ride to work, and then work for eight hours-this is indentured time. When you spend your entire weekend “recharging” from the workweek, this is indentured time. Indentured time is actual work and the work
you must do for the work. However, the irony of your free time is it isn't FREE;
it's bought and paid for by your indentured time. You enjoy a two-week vacation
because it was paid for by a year of indentured time. You can relax with a cold
beer on the couch because you paid for it earlier in the day with eight hours of
indentured time. Indentured time becomes the ransom of your free time. Fast lanners are frugal with time, while Slow lanners are frugal with money. </p>

### Education

<p text align = "justify"> 

The Fastlane road trip demands fresh oil changes for improved performance . But what is oil? Oil is
education. Knowledge. Street smarts. But be careful … it must be the right oil
and for the right purpose. Slow lanners oil their vehicles for the explicit purpose of
raising intrinsic value. Advanced education and certifications: What's going to
command a bigger salary? Fast lanners oil their vehicles until they hit the
junkyard. Education, your oil, is a critical component to your wealth road trip. When you
continually inject yourself with new education, new skills, and new
competencies, new roads open and things run smoothly. The right education has
incredible horsepower. The purpose of education within the Fastlane is to amplify
the power of the money tree and the business system or to enhance your judgment for better decisions . You're not a cog in the wheel; you learn to build the wheel. Fastlane education is to foster growth of the business system. Conversely, Slow lanners education is designed to specifically
enhance the intrinsic value of the person receiving the education. In today's
information society, there is absolutely no excuse not to find out how something works. I'm astonished that education is freely available, yet most choose not to take it.
Education is unplucked fruit from a tree, and all it needs is a ladder. Yet, people
cling to the limiting belief that “I can't afford education.” Sorry, but it's an excuse to be lazy. Skills and expertise are waiting just for you. No one drops a book on your lap and gifts knowledge. You have to seek it, process it, and then use it. The acquisition and application of knowledge will make you rich.
</p>

### Are You Interested or Committed ?

<p text align = "justify">
   Who doesn't want to worry about money? Unfortunately, it
doesn't take any effort to be “interested” in wealth and financial security. Interest
is kindergarten; it isn't enough, and those who have “interest” live in first gear.
To get out of first gear, you must make a concerted effort and a lineage of good
choices to exploit the power of the Fastlane. There's a profound difference
between interest and commitment.
Interest reads a book; commitment applies the book 50 times. Interest wants to
start a business; commitment files LLC paperwork. Interest works on your
business an hour a day Monday through Friday; commitment works on your
business seven days a week whenever time permits. Interest leases an expensive
car; commitment rides a bike and puts the money into your system. Interest is quitting after the
third failure; commitment is continuing after the hundredth. How bad do you want it? How willing are you? Are you willing to sleep in your car for it? Are you willing to live in a tiny apartment while your friends own houses? Are you willing to forgo the new BMW in favor of a rust bucket with
150,000 miles? Are you willing to wait tables at Maloney's Bar and Grill when
your friends have cushy $50K/year jobs? How willing are you?
Most people aren't willing, and it separates the winners from the losers. The idea
of living in the rat race for 50 years has to be more painful than the idea of
working your ass off to escape it. Bill Gates is a one-hit wonder. He built one company and made billions. One company was all it took. Some might say I'm a one-hit wonder. Great. I'd rather
be a one-hit wonder than a no-hit wonder. One hit is all it takes, and you could
be set for life. Intelligent risks have a limited downside, while
their upside is unlimited. Moronic risks have a bottomless downside and their
upside is limited, or short term.

</p>


## The Five Commandments of the Fastlane

### Control

<p text align = "justify">
Yes or no. You're either driving the Fastlane or you aren't. There is no in between. And if
you're not driving, you're sitting in the passenger seat and someone else is in
control of your financial plan. When you control your business, you control everything in your business-your organization, your products, your pricing, your revenue model, and your operational choices. If you can't control every aspect of your company, you're not driving! And if you can't
drive, you set yourself up for sudden, unexpected crashes. Drivers create MLM companies; they don't join them. Drivers sell franchises; they don't buy them. Drivers offer affiliate programs; they don't join them. Drivers run hedge funds; they don't invest in them. Drivers sell stock; they don't buy stock. Drivers offer drop-shipping; they don't use drop-shipping. Drivers offer employment; they don't get employed. Drivers accept rents and royalties; they don't pay rents and royalties.
Drivers sell licenses; they don't buy them. Drivers sell IPO shares; they don't buy them. you must understand that The driver retains control and makes the big money. At best, the hitchhiker
makes good money. No control. No say. No power. I can't imagine running a company in which another entity has the power to instantaneously kill my revenue stream. If someone can “flip a switch” and destroy your business, you're playing roulette with your financial plan. The
congenital danger of hitchhiking is that you relinquish control to the driver. If the
driver crashes into a wall, guess who goes with them. You. as a hitchhiker you waive all power to your driver. He who owns the keys owns the power. Network marketing is a Fastlane but only if you own the network marketing company. As a Fast lanner, you want to create these companies, not join them. If I ever invent a product that needs distribution, network marketing would be my first consideration. Furthermore, MLM has excellent educational value: sales, motivation, team-building, and networking.
</p>

<p text align = "justify">

The Business world has the dynamics of the Jungle. Just as in the jungle, where multiple species compete fiercely for survival, businesses compete relentlessly for the attention and resources of consumers. Every company is a predator in this Game, hunting for its next meal: money. And just like in the jungle, where only the most skilled and powerful predators rise to the top of the food chain, in business, only the most innovative and successful companies are able to dominate the market and capture the lion's share of the profits. It's a never-ending battle for supremacy, a constant struggle to stay ahead of the competition and remain at the top of the food chain.

</p>

### Entry

<p text align = "justify">

The Commandment of Entry states that as entry barriers to any business road
fall, or lessen, the effectiveness of that road declines while competition in that
field subsequently strengthens. Higher entry barriers equate to stronger, more
powerful roads with less competition and less need for exceptionality. Low barrier-
entry businesses are weak roads because easy entry creates high
competition and high traffic. In other words, if “getting into business” is as simple as paying $200 for a distributor kit, there are no entry barriers, and the opportunity should be passed.
If any Joe Blow napping behind Chan's Chinese restaurant in the alley next to a
dumpster can start your business in minutes, it isn't a business you want to be
doing! The world is littered with so-called businesses that have no entry barriers.
And that is why they suck and the people who follow them aren't rich. 
Saturation causes noise: As more people enter the same market, the amount of advertising and promotional messages aimed at consumers increases, creating a "noisy" environment in which it becomes more difficult for any one message to be heard or noticed.
Noise causes declining sales volumes: When consumers are bombarded with too much noise and too many choices, they may become overwhelmed and tune out, leading to a decline in sales volumes. Declining sales volumes cause profit erosion. If you're in a room with 2,000 other people who do exactly what you do, you're fighting stiff probabilities. When it
comes to entry, your industry and your business should not be available to
everyone, because if it is, you must be prepared to be exceptional. Exceptionality breaks the odds of entry. There's an old saying, “In a gold rush, don't dig for gold, sell shovels!”.  providing necessary means and infrastructure to help others pursue opportunities can be very profitable. You don't have to chase the opportunity yourself to benefit from it. When it comes to money, the best warning flag is “everyone.”.  If everyone is doing it, I won't be doing it. if everyone is buying it , you sell it . if everyone is selling it, you buy it . How do I know when “everyone is doing it?” Simple. When there is irrational exuberance about any investment that pervades to Team
Consumer-the general populous-that's when I know it is time to GET OUT AND
STAY OUT. When the plumber comes over to fix the toilet and raves about his three rental
properties that have appreciated 15% in the last three months, it's time to get out
and stay out. When your personal trainer raves about his Internet stock portfolio
that earned 40% in two months, it's time to get out and stay out. But some shrewd people have mastered the Rule of Everyone. Instead of getting out, they short the other side and profit from the downfall. Here is an example of short selling a stock: 1. You borrow shares of a stock from a broker. 2. You sell those borrowed shares on the market at their current market price. 3. You wait for the price of the stock to go down. 4. When the price of the stock goes down, you buy back the shares on the market at the lower price.  5. You return the borrowed shares to your broker and keep the difference between the price at which you sold the shares and the price at which you bought them back. If you want to live unlike everyone, you can't be like everyone.

</p>
### Need

<p text align = "justify">
Businesses that solve needs win. Businesses that provide value win. Businesses that solve problems win profits. why on God's green Earth should I give your business money? What value are you adding to my life? Stop thinking about business in terms of your selfish desires, whether it's money,
dreams or “do what you love.” Instead, chase needs, problems, pain points, service deficiencies, and emotions. Do What You Love is the biggest scam of the Decade. No one cares about what 
you love or do , Everybody cares about Their own problems and Needs. Focus on that . The amount of money in your life is merely a reflection to the amount of value you have given to others. Successful businesses share one common trait: The satisfaction of consumer
needs as reflected by sales in the marketplace. The marketplaces and consumers,
not you, determine if your business is viable. If you sell 10 million anything, 10
million people have voted that your product will help them, or satisfy one of
their needs. Make a freaking impact and start providing value! Let money come to you!
It isn't for you to decide whether you are useful. The marketplace makes that determination.
If you got no money , it means you haven't contributed anything to the society. If you did,  People would pay for their satisfaction. so you are trash and unimportant. At my gym, a personal trainer acquaintance told me he is struggling to make ends meet. When I asked why, he responded that personal training is so competitive that he can't charge a price worth his time. His service fees are
deflationary, caused by an abundant supply of trainers, and when supply exceeds
demand (need) prices move down. Not enough need, too much supply.
So why is the field for personal trainers so saturated? Simple. People follow the
espoused grotesque advice without reflection on need: “Do what you love.”
Unfortunately, if you LOVE doing it, bet on thousands of others loving it too.
When you “do what you love,” prepare to face stiff competition. Who enjoys
higher margins? The personal trainer? Or the guy who starts a company to
cleanup crime scenes? If you are forced to do anything, even
something you purport to love, in exchange for a paycheck, that love is put in
danger. When I was in startup mode with my company, I worked long hours. Was I
suffering the toil of work? No. I enjoyed it, because I had my “whys” and I was
moving toward them. The journey hardened me, challenged me, and yes, it was
even fun! I was passionate about what I wanted and I was going to get it. The
Fastlane isn't a destination but a personal journey.  A road that doesn't converge with your dreams is a dead end. When you concede dreams, life withers. if your dream is dead, so is your passion. “No passion” numbs you to the greatest violinist in the world while he plays in the train depot. “No passion” leads to mediocrity and the land of everybody. “No passion” leads to
unhappiness. “No passion” equals no wealth.
</p>
### Time

<p text align = "justify">
Can your business substitute for you and blossom into a money tree? Remember this: Owning a business doesn't guarantee wealth or detachment from time. Some business owners are married to their businesses because their businesses violate the Commandment of Time. Often people get into business with the wrong idea of what it will be like. Fueled by gurus and life coaches, many are misled, believing that “be your own boss” and “do what you love” is enough motivational fire to
sprout success. As a Fast lanner, your road should be traveled with the intention to make it
automated. You want passivity and a living money tree. If your business is based on one of the money-tree seedlings, it should be capable of growing a money tree. Content systems, computer systems, software systems, distribution systems, and human resource systems are all seedlings to
money trees.

### Scale

<p text align = "justify">
Scale is about leverage and leverage is what gives the Fastlane wealth equation its power.
Business leverage is like a playing field, or a habitat of water. You can choose to
inhabit the ocean or a pool at the local park. There are six business habitats:
Local/community (pool)
County/city (pond)
Statewide (lagoon)
Regional (lake)
National (sea)
Worldwide (ocean).
The larger the habitat, the greater the potential speed,
or leverage, of your Fastlane. To break scale, the business
owner needs to introduce leverage in the form of replication: Open more stores,
sell franchises, or sell on the Internet.  If you're a massage therapist, you won't
awake one day and have 10,000 patrons outside your door. There is no leverage!
And if you don't have leverage in the Fastlane equation, you don't have a chance!

To achieve scale, magnitude or reach must increase. Magnitude is naturally
increased with price or cost. If you sell Lamborghinis over Hyundai's, you have
greater magnitude simply by the implicit price of Lamborghinis. You are near
Effection (Lamborghini owners most likely exploit the Law of Effection). If you
are a real estate agent for the rich and sell multimillion dollar estates, you
achieve magnitude implicit by price. Higher prices and cost implicitly drive
magnitude. If you successfully sell the most expensive apartment building in
Manhattan, you have had an effect of magnitude and realize scale. If you are
operating with magnitude, you are near or at Effection.  Reach is massive numbers.
The more people you reach, the greater scale potential. The guy stuck on Main Street selling sandwiches has no scale and no magnitude. Effection always trickles up to owners and producers,
not down to employees or consumers. drive a road that can break through
scale or magnitude while controlling its source. Think big, but think scale and/or magnitude. Analyze your Fastlane equation and examine the variables. What are your maximum units sold and maximum profit per unit? What is the size of your customer pool?

## The Three Pure Fastlane Roads
<p text align = "justify">
I call the most potent Fastlane roads “The Three I's,” or “The Three Interstates,”
because they possess the fastest upper speed limits and meet, or can meet, all
five Fastlane commandments. The three Interstates are:
</p>
#Internet

<p text align = "justify">
The Internet is the best Fastlane
available, because it immediately obeys the Five Commandments to the
Fastlane, assuming a need-based premise. It naturally scales to a worldwide
audience, it systematizes to automation via computer systems, it is a medium
you can control (unfortunately, most don't), and its barriers are still strong
enough to prevent “everyone” from entry. has made more
millionaires in the last decade than any other medium out there. The Internet is the shark of the Fastlane.

</p>
#### Subscription based business models

<p text align = "justify">
Offer users access to data, information, or software, and charge a monthly fee.
Data can be leads, sales information, a proprietary database. When 10,000 people pay you $9.95 per month for your information, you're balling the Fastlane! When I owned my company, I paid for many Web services, all subscription
based. From data analytics (who is visiting my site?) to affiliate management
(who wants to offer my service?).
One particular company ran a Website monitoring service that kept track of Web
site uptime. On its home page it advertised how many clients it monitored. At
the time, it listed “20,000 clients served,” and I was paying $50 per month for
service. Assuming my fee was average, 20,000 X $50 = $1,000,000 in gross
revenue-PER MONTH. This is a perfect example of an Internet business system
in which the business is the system. No products. No shipping. No headaches

</p>
#### Content based business models

<p text align = "justify">
Content-based business models are those that rely on creating and distributing valuable content for free consumption and sell advertising to parties who want to reach those eyeballs. examples may include Digital Media companies that produces news , articles and blogs. I consider content-based revenue models the most difficult for success because
entry barriers have significantly declined and its success is predicated on high
traffic. Also, content systems heavily engage in affiliate programs, which is a
hitchhiking structure.

</p>

#### Lead generation systems

<p text align = "justify">
Lead generation services are typically designed to help businesses or organizations identify potential customers or clients, and ultimately generate more sales or business opportunities by providing information about a specific topic or industry. The company I created years before falls under this category. There was an information need on how much it costs  for A limousine service to go from point A to Point B. I undressed that issue and sold  contact information of my web visitors for limousine service companies.

</p>

#### Brokerage Systems

<p text align = "justify">
Brokerage systems are platforms or software applications that facilitate the buying and selling of goods or services between buyers and sellers. In a brokerage system, the platform acts as an intermediary between the buyer and seller, providing a secure and efficient way for them to conduct transactions earn money typically on each transaction. examples are - PayPal, stripe, chapa, 

</p>


#Innovation

<p text align = "justify">
Inventing is still recognized as the default get-rich-quick method out there, and
yes, it is alive and well. However, don't be fooled. Inventing isn't really about
inventing the vehicle, the telephone, or the goofy Segway-the core activity of
inventors is just taking something and improving or modifying it. Take
something old and stale and make it better. Take an underexposed product, make
it your own, and reintroduce it to the world. Take something unconventional and
make it conventional. Innovation is a dual challenged process: manufacture and distribution. Inventing a product that solves a need is half the battle; the other half is getting your
invention into the hands of millions, which involves a variety of distribution
channels: infomercial (sell via mass media), retail (sell to distributors and
wholesalers), and direct marketing. A great product
is worthless if it doesn't get into the hands of people, and that requires
distribution.

</p>

#Intensional-Iteration

<p text align = "justify">
For example, when a real estate investor buys a single-family home at a bank
auction and later rents it out, there is no scale, and with that one act, nothing can
create scale. The investor has little wiggle room in his Fastlane wealth equation:
Net income is derived from rent and asset value is derived by the home's market
value.
To solve that challenge, the investor engages in II and repeats the process.
Instead of buying one home, he buys 50. Yes, easier said than done, and it can be
incredibly slow. If you build a small store with the goal of intentional iteration, your goal isn't
one store, but hundreds, perhaps thousands, through the act of chaining or
franchising.

</p>
## How To Find Opportunities

<p text align = "justify">
If you can't see the opportunities that surround you every day, you haven't tuned
your Fastlane frequency to them. When you make a few minor mental
adjustments, roads seemingly closed are suddenly opened. Many entrepreneurs
misinterpret opportunity because they associate opportunity with breakthrough,
legendary ideas. They seek virgin ideas, perfect and new; ones that would be
unveiled to the world in a grandiose affair. Rarely does that happen.
Opportunity is rarely about some blockbuster breakthrough like the light bulb or
the car, but as simple as an unmet need, or a need not met adequately.
Opportunity is a solution to an inconvenience. Opportunity is simplification.
Opportunity is a feeling. Opportunity is comfort. Opportunity is better service.
Opportunity is fixing pain. Opportunity is putting weak companies out of
business. “Someone is doing it” is a monumental illusion imposing as an impassable
obstacle. Someone is always already doing it. The bigger question is, can you do
it better? Can you fill the need better, offer greater value, or be a better marketer?
Competition is everywhere. Just do it and do it better.” You
don't need an idea that has never been done before. Years ago, what if Sergey Brin and Larry Page looked at the Internet landscape
and said “Gee, there are plenty of search engines out there-Yahoo, Snap,
AltaVista-why start Google? It's being done!” Thankfully, they didn't, and now
Google is the most used search engine, and because of it, Brin and Page are now
billionaires. A brand-spanking new idea? Nope, a need solved better with big
execution. Wayne Huizinga founded Waste Management with just one truck and
a handful of customers. He later built Waste Management into a Fortune 500
company. Is garbage a new need? Or a need that needed better fulfillment? It
was an open road when the road seemed closed. The opportunities of open roads come in easily painted language: Discomfort, distress, inconvenience, complaints, problems, and performance gaps. You must attack these challenges and introduce solutions and
I guarantee money will follow! Moral: Solve other people's problems and you
will solve your own money problems!



</p>
## The Price of Freedom: Money
<p text align = "justify">
The end of the Fastlane road trip is to
crown your happiness with freedom. Freedom from financial encumbrances,
freedom to travel, freedom from bosses, alarm clocks, two-hour commutes;
freedom from bad ratios (9-to-5, 5-for-2, 2 weeks every 52 weeks and 8% over
40 years) and freedom to enjoy the world as your playground. You can't build a financial empire if you're ignorant of basic finance and economics. These disciplines are the building blocks to a financial empire. Remember, more money doesn't solve money problems. To successfully leverage a money system for passivity, you have to familiarize
yourself with financial instruments that fuel the money system. Do you know
how to calculate simple interest? Return on investment? Do you know what
happens to the price of a bond when interest rates go up? Can you figure out the
difference between a tax-free yield and a taxable yield? These concepts harden
your road to wealth. Live below your means with the intent to expand your means. Slow lanners seek to minimize expenses while the Fast lanner seeks to maximize
income and asset values . Hiring a
financial adviser doesn't fix financial illiteracy. Literacy gives you the power to evaluate your adviser's advice. if you can't audit your adviser, you don't have control. If you can't critique
good advice from bad you don't have control. Financial illiteracy exposes you to risk, and in the worst case scenario, fraud.
Bernard Madoff's investment fund defrauded thousands, and billions were lost,
but what's more shocking is that the whistle was blown years before. You see,
when you are financially illiterate, you are deaf, and when you are deaf, you
can't hear the whistle. After reading this book you have the complete information which acts as your fuel for your fast lane vehicle. you
know exactly what you want and where you want to go. You've picked a road,
and it's time to hit the accelerator. The fact is, most people-whether they agree
with Fastlane strategy or not-will do nothing with the information. They'll stare
at the roadmap but never take the road and hit the accelerator. It's one thing to
possess the treasure map; it's another to get out of the house and follow it.

<p text align = "justify">
Chess is a complex game with complex maneuvers, and your business must 
run similarly. Unfortunately, most business owners approach business one dimensionally,
like a game of checkers, and doing so puts the owner into a
winless game. Checkers is one-dimensional because all the pieces move
identically, while chess is multidimensional because each piece moves
differently with different roles. The business owner who plays checkers has one
offensive and defensive play in the playbook: price. Raise prices, lower prices,
cut costs, cheaper suppliers: “Oh Lord, how can I be the cheapest so everyone
buys from me?”. Put the checkers away and play chess, where each
chess piece represents a specific function within your business. How you play with
each function will determine if you win or lose the game. The pieces in your chess board are marketing, customer service, product quality, human resource, and public relations . use all of them not only the price. An idea trapped in your brain is like a supercar trapped in the garage with a dead battery. It accomplishes nothing and its purpose is untapped. Execution is
making an idea real and giving the battery a charge. Execution is taking that
Lamborghini out of the garage and slamming the accelerator to the floor. You might think you got a great idea but the truth is they are already shared by hundreds of others. owner of an idea is not he who imagines it, but he who executes it. He who thinks the idea owns nothing.
He who executes the idea owns everything. Figure out what needs figuring and just go do it. The world will do its job and tell you the directions to travel. The best business plan in the world will always be a track record of execution. I started my company on a shoestring and 900 bucks. No investors, no funding, and no help.  As my ideas crystallized into tangible assets that could be consumed by the world, suddenly I became the approachable asset. Venture capitalists and angel
investors called me-I didn't call them. Suddenly, people wanted to see my
business plan. Why the sudden change of heart? Wasn't I the same guy just years
earlier? Sure, but instead of an idea on paper, I had a tangible concept that
reflected execution. If you want investors, get out
and execute! Create a prototype! Create a brand! Create a track record that others
can see or touch! Dive into process. When you have a physical manifestation of
an idea, investors will open their wallets. Heck, be good enough and they will be
fighting to give you money. You see, when you have nothing except 120 pages of text, charts, and graphs, that shows organizational skills, not execution. Angels to private equity never
invest in business plans-they invest in people with track records of execution. The bishop in
business's chess match is your customer service, and how you treat the people
who buy your product or service. When I negotiated with potential buyers for my company, I was asked frequently: “How much do you spend to recruit advertisers?” My unexpected
answer? Zero. When your clients love your business,
they become disciples and advertise for you. They become unpaid human
resource systems, evangelists who drop your name wherever necessary. Nothing
overcomes poor human experiences! Your employees communicate the public's perception of your company. </p>
<p text align = "justify">
Partnerships are marriages. After the love affair and the lust wears off, they must
survive on character, synergy, and complementary attributes.  Do you have the same work ethic? Will your partner skate while you burn
the midnight oil?
Do you have the same vision? Or will they compete with each other?
Do you want to grow slowly while your partner wants to own the world and
do it fast?
Do you want to sell franchises while your partner just wants one unit that
pays the bills?
Do you trust this person with your life?
Do you have the same personality type?  The fact is people engage in partnerships for the wrong reasons. Like people start businesses under false premises (not need-oriented), they also form
partnerships under a similar false premise: Diversification. The partners don't
seek synergy; they seek diversification of risk, expense, and workload. Often,
each partner looks to the other for the burden to bear, and when one bears more,
resentment builds. Partnerships can work, just like a lot of marriages work. Just
make sure you know whom you're engaged to. If I didn't have good team of A's-accountants and attorneys-I'd be poorer. And yes, these people aren't easy to find because they're like partners under contract, another group of individuals who have the keys to your castle. Treat your two A's like you would any partner, because they have unfettered access to your castle, and those
with the keys have the potential to steer you wrong.

<p text align = "justify">
If your product doesn't
standout in the crowd, it doesn't stand a chance and you're forced into the
strategy of “cutting prices to stand out from the crowd.” which is a cheekers game.
Forget about your competition 95% of the
time. The other 5% should be used to exploit their weaknesses and differentiate
your business. If you forget about your competition, you're forced to focus on
your business, which is to innovate and win over the hearts and minds of your
customers. And when you fill needs and your army of customers grows,
something suddenly happens: Everyone follows you. Have you ever bought a product from television, and when you used it, it sucked and didn't perform as advertised? Then, in dissatisfaction, you tried to return it and got the runaround from a guy who sounded like he had a double-digit IQ? That is the power of marketing: bad people, bad service, and bad product, but
AWESOME MARKETING. If you have an OK product (a weak knight), poor
customer service (drunk bishops), and incompetent people (a castle full of
idiots), you can survive with a powerful queen. The queen is the most powerful piece in chess and it is also in business. Marketing can convince people to buy mediocre products. Marketing can hide or disguise service flaws. Marketing can shadow incompetence, and marketing can
keep convicted felons disparate from their product. The power of marketing is
that a powerful ad campaign can move products, regardless of the cockroaches
hiding underneath. Build a Brand, Not a Business. Apple, the computer maker, is a great example of building a brand based on a need, or a nuisance. People hate viruses, spyware, and the constant “Your updates are ready” messages that are associated with PC computers. Apple
exploited PC's weaknesses and solved their problems. It has built itself into one
of the most successful brands in history. Apple isn't the cheapest because they've
engineered a brand and they can demand a higher price. The objective of a USP (unique selling preposition) is to be unique when compared to the alternatives. This impregnates the consumer with a logical argument for choosing your company. Domino's Pizza didn't say “Delivered on time,” they said, “Delivered within 30 minutes or it's free.” It was a specific action and evidence of that action. (Your pizza is free if we don't perform!) In my case, the onus was on me to send my
advertisers leads. If I didn't, I didn't get paid. “We send you business or you don't
pay a dime.” Use Polarization marketing strategy to drive traffic to your website or online store. The perfect example of this strategy is Andrew Tate who has been known to take strong stances on a variety of controversial issues, such as gender roles, sexuality, and political correctness. By doing so, he has attracted a loyal following of individuals who share his views and are drawn to his bold and unapologetic style. If you want to draw eye balls talk about sex because it will always sell. Most consumer buying decisions are driven by emotions. You and I buy stuff because we want to feel something. I don't buy a Lamborghini to go from point
A to point B; that's practicality. I buy to feel something-pride, achievement,
uniqueness, adrenaline, and fame.  If you can move your audience's emotions and make them care, they will buy. Interact with your customers and build relationships that last. people wanna talk about themselves all the time. If you get someone's attention, half the battle is won. The other half is letting selfishness take over your audience and tailor your messages to self-interest. In
other words, the good old “What's in it for me?” How about saving 15% or more
on your car insurance? People don't care about you, your business, your product or your dreams;
they want to help themselves and their family. It's human nature. 
</p>


<p text align = "justify"> 

Price is a brand-builder because price implies value. The more expensive your
price, the higher its perceived value. The cheaper your price, the cheaper its
perceived value. Price isn't simply a number that tells someone what something
costs. It conveys value and worth. I had multiple competitors who undercut me by
10%, sometimes even 20%. Yet I continued to prosper. I wasn't the cheapest, so
why did I do well? My service had better value, and I kept my price correlated to
that value. My artist friend, who painted the most exquisite, beautiful paintings, priced her
work through her own limited price filter. She was a single mom, struggling to
the pay the bills, living paycheck to paycheck. For her, $500 was an
extraordinary amount, and because of that, she priced her works far below their
true value. Her own corrupted vision of price distorted her earning power and
degraded the perceived value of her work. I have a fascination with designer purses
because I admire their pricing strategy. How does a handbag sell for $4,000
when it probably costs them less than $100 to produce? Branding and marketing.
Price is apart of the brand build. To use price for
your brand, you have to convince the consumer of value beyond the cost of its
practicality. What makes you different from the rest? Why should someone pay
you more? As a marketer you have to drill into your buyer's mind and get your
brand differentiated. Own the consumer's mind and you own the consumer.
