# Book Annotations on Obsidian

This repository contains my book annotations made on Obsidian, a knowledge management tool. The purpose of this repository is to share my annotations with others who may find them useful or interesting.

## Getting Started

To access the annotations, simply navigate to the relevant Author's folder and open the `.md` files. Each annotation is organized by chapter and includes my personal notes and highlights.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions from anyone who has also made book annotations on Obsidian. If you would like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new branch for your annotations
3. Add your annotations to the relevant book folder
4. Submit a pull request

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank the Obsidian team for creating such a powerful and intuitive knowledge management tool. Without Obsidian, these annotations would not have been possible.
